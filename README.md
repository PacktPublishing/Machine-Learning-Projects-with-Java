## About the Video Course
Developers are worried about using various algorithms to solve different problems. This course is a perfect guide to identifying the best solution to efficiently build machine learning projects for different use cases to solve real-world problems. 

In this course, you will learn how to build a model that takes complex feature vector form sensor data and classifies data points into classes with similar characteristics. Then you will predict the price of a house based on historical data. Finally, you will build a Deep Learning model that can guess personality traits using labeled data.

By the end of this course, you will have mastered each machine learning domain and will be able to build your own powerful projects at work
